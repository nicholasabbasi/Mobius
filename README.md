# Vision Statement
Speedrunning. The goal to complete a game as fast as possible. While every game can be completed as fast as possible, some games are more fun to speed run. These are games where RNG takes a back seat, ones that are not too long, ones that have a great deal of control over the character. Games like Super Mario World and Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. Taking notes from the best speed running games and combining the fun of designing a route and optimizing movement is the goal of Möbius. By forcing every player to play the same game multiple times with a fixed time limit, we allow them to do these same actions of optimizing movement and designing a route. By combining a story that revolves around this time limit and puzzles to complete as fast as possible, we hope to make the ultimate speed running game.

The game takes place in a Western Town known as Refuge to its inhabitants. It is unknown outside of the town due to the time repeating bubble surrounding the town. Our hero wakes up at the entrance to the town, having just been thrown in by his captors. He needs to find a way out, and figure out why the town is in the bubble in the first place. As he explores the first time, he hears the clock strike noon and the town and the surrounding desert explode, killing him instantly. He then wakes up in the exact same spot as he did the first time, with the only thing changed is the memories he formed of the previous encounters.

# Audience
This has a specific and general target audience.

### Specific Audience: Speedrunners

Speedrunners are a dedicated fanbase of certain games. They tend to value similar things in a game, specifically movement techniques and a lack of RNG. By having no RNG in the entire game and allowing for a variety of movement, we cater to this audience the most. 

### General Audience: Other

Of course, it is too narrow of a focus to only have one small target audience, especially when it is a target audience that is mostly built off of a few high profile people that might ignore the game entirely. 

So, we look to other games here. We do this by adding a story to the repeating and allowing for character development and puzzles. These things are similar to other games such as Firewatch, where you do a lot of talking and walking, and Zelda, in which you solve puzzles to progress.

### Platform:
PC, with ability to move Multiplatform easily. PC is the home of experimental games and the market that most accepts indie games. With our choice of Unity, we keep the ability to move Multiplatform to PS4, Xbox One (X/S) and Switch if the game is a commercial success.


## Legal
This is based off of The Adventure Zone Podcast, which might have some legal repercussions later on if an agreement isn't struck. However, this can be avoided by changing everything enough that we can claim inspiration without infringing on Trademark.

# Story
You have been forced into this time bubble, which is being supported by the Temporal Chalice. This chalice has total control over time. It is being used to loop time within this bubble. At the end of each loop the town is destroyed and everyone within dies.

The game takes place in a Western Town known as Refuge to its inhabitants. It is unknown outside of the town due to the time repeating bubble surrounding the town. Our hero wakes up at the entrance to the town, having just been thrown in by his captors. He needs to find a way out, and figure out why the town is in the bubble in the first place. As he explores the first time, he hears the clock strike noon and the town and the surrounding desert explode, killing him instantly. He then wakes up in the exact same spot as he did the first time, with the only thing changed is the memories he formed of the previous encounters.

He wakes up next to Rowsell, the guardian of the village. If he fails to convince Roswell that he isn't a threat, he will die.
